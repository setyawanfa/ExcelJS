# ExcelJS

Using native JavaScript, I created ExcelJS to include the following functionality.

- Ability to add m x n cells in the sheet.
- Add/remove rows and columns to/from the existing sheet.
- Clicking on each cell should make it as editable and clicking anywhere else should take the cell back to read-only mode.
- Should have ability to sort the data. (Numerical, alpha-numeric and alphabetic).
